This project is from 2023.<br/>
Our A* Maze Runner application is an AI based project created using Python, Tkinter, and utilizes the pathfinding algorithm A* search.<br/>
This AI based project was created to change the perspective of students and educators passionate about exploring the complexities of the A* algorithm.<br/>
The main objective of our project was to give access to a maze generation, maze solving algorithm, and a feature to visualize the solution of a user given maze.<br/>
Users can experiment with different maze sizes, wall probability, and establish start/end points.<br/>
Additionally, the A* Maze Runner application offers a step by step guidance that shows users which coordinate the maze runner has moved to next.<br/>
The team has created unique application that can help understand the ways the A* pathfinding algorithm works and helps create custom mazes that can be used for educational purposes.<br/>
Further information can be found in the project report and project presentation files.<br/><br/>
